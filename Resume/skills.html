        <td> <font size="10"><u><b>C/C++</b></u></font><br/><br/> Through more college courses I have learned to use these two languages to make simple to complex input/output calculation programs and work with multiple advanced data structures. </td>
          <td> <font size="10"><u><b>HTML/JS/CSS</b></u></font><br/><br/> I have used the combination of these three to create multiple web app design and usability features. </td>
            <td> <font size="10"><u><b>Backend</b></u></font><br/><br/>I have used SQL and multiple APIs to create a web app that uses a server to input and return data to and from a database. </td>

          <td> <font size="10"><u><b>Patience</b></u></font><br/><br/> I have learned to use the most of my time and not to rush assignments since it usually leads to more errors and less efficiency. Additionally to have the patience to look over my work and make sure it is understandable to others as well. </td>
            <td> <font size="10"><u><b>Endurance</b></u></font><br/><br/>After suffering through a plethora of bugs and errors I have learned to embrace stalls in progress and push towards a solution and pretty much never surrender. </td>
              <td> <font size="10"><u><b>Time Management</b></u></font><br/><br/> I have managed to not miss many deadlines at all since I always give myself the time I need for certain tasks after taking the time to think about how much I need for each task and how much time I should have extra of in case something does not go as planned. </td>
