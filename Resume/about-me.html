    <p class = "aboutme_p" id = "professionaltext"> <strong>Professionally</strong>, I am currently a <strong>University of California San Diego</strong> student trying to get a career in coding frontend or backend.
      I am <strong>determined</strong> to solve oncoming problems and am
      <strong>ready</strong> to learn anything I need so that I can be prepared and accomplish any <strong>goal</strong>
      before me. When given a task I face it <strong>head on</strong> first so that I know
      what I am dealing with. When it gets challenging I <strong>conduct</strong> online research
      for guidance and so that I can learn how to <strong>accomplish</strong> a task efficiently. Additionally
      and most importantly, I <strong>confide</strong> in my coworkers so that I can get some <strong>input</strong>
      and maybe come up with a solution <strong>together</strong>. </p>
  </div>

  <p class = "aboutme_p" hidden id = "personaltext"> Aside from coding and design, I love to <strong>create</strong> music.
      I'll pick up my electric guitar or my MIDI keyboard and <strong>discover</strong> a riff or even a song.
      I feel like creating riffs or songs builds up my <strong>creativity</strong> that I use
      to find unique ideas to code or design. I also really enjoy beating and <strong>competing</strong> in video games
      and hope I get the opportunity to design and code for some.
      In fact, one of my <strong>goals</strong> is to create a virtual reality game mixing rhythm and caligraphy.
      However, when I play, I play to <strong>improve</strong> just as I would in a work environtment. I learn all sorts of skills and <strong>techniques</strong>
      to improve my toolbox so that I can beat and opponent, boss, or project.
