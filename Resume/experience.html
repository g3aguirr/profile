    <p hidden class = "experience_p" id = "csminortext" > I learned fundamentals across several programming languages such as Java, C++, C, Shell. I also learned discrete math
      allowing for a better understanding of algorithms and number systems. Combining these two, I was able to work with high-performance data structures to accomplish certain
      programs such as recursively mapping a large dataset of actors by movies they share.
      </p>

    <p hidden class = "experience_p" id = "csmajortext"> I learned about designing and building original practical web applications (frontend and backend) in a group setting.
      In the process, I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, Express, and many APIs.
      Additionally, I learned design outside of coding such as rapid prototyping and experimentation using Google Analytics and exploring data and statistics using Python.
        </p>
    <p hidden class = "experience_p" id = "adventuretext"> I'm working with virtual reality by joining UCSD's virtual reality club where we learn, test, and create
      virtual reality projects. I got to learn C# and use Unity Engine and Maya to create an object in a virtual world and interact with it using the HTC VIVE. I also learned
      about coding music programs using Pure Data from the man who created it and editing synthwaves from online sources so that I can create digital music.</p>
